# Fast-Paced Movement Shooter Prototype in Godot 4

A dynamic first-person movement shooter prototype created in Godot Engine 4.x, featuring high-speed movement, a functional grappling hook, and simple AI-driven enemies.  
The project is being develdoped by me and my friends from pure passion, need to give others something amazing and drive for gaining knowledge, expirience and skills in physics-based gameplay development.

## Features
- Advanced slide, walljump, jetpack flight
- Functional grappling hook with swinging mechanics and interactions with enemies
- Simple enemy AI (patrolling, chasing, attacking)
- Test scene to try our technologies

## Technologies Used
- Godot Engine 4.x
- GDScript
- Blender (models)
- Git for version control

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Godot Engine 4.x
3. Press F5 to run

## Reflections
This project helped me improve my understanding of Godotâ€™s physics engine, custom movement coding, and efficient modular design. It also taught me how to debug complex interactions between nodes and signals.
