# Fast-Paced Movement Shooter Prototype in Godot 4

A dynamic first-person movement shooter prototype developed in Godot Engine 4.x, featuring high-speed movement, a functional grappling hook, and simple AI-driven enemies.
The project is being developed by me and my friends out of pure passion — driven by the desire to create something exciting for others and to gain experience, knowledge, and skills in physics-based gameplay development.
## Project Vision
On the surface, this game is about throwing pork chops and beating enemies with a frying pan.
However, we are preparing a dark and twisted storyline underneath, involving a tyrant, a savior, and a touch of cosmic body horror.

## Our current features:
-Advanced movement system (sliding, wall-jumping, jetpack flight)
-Interactive items (healing pieróg, jetpack, two throwable weapons)
-Functional grappling hook with swinging mechanics and enemy interactions
-Basic enemy AI (patrolling, chasing, attacking)
-Test scene showcasing core mechanics

## What we use:
- Godot Engine 4.x
- GDScript
- Blender (models)
- Git for version control

## Quick controls tutorial:
- F — pick up items
- Q — use grappling hook
- LMB — attack
- RMB — block with frying pan
- WASD — movement
- Ctrl — slide
- Space — jump
- Tab — fly with jetpack
- Mouse Scroll — switch weapons
- V — equip frying pan
- E - heal with pieróg

## How to setup:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Godot Engine 4.x
3. Press F5 to run

This project has helped me deepen my understanding of Godot’s physics engine, develop custom movement systems, and design modular, reusable scenes.
It also taught me how to debug complex interactions between nodes and signals efficiently.
